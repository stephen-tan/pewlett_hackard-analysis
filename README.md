# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to use SQL to generate queries to determine the number of retiring employees (born between 1952-1955) by job title as well as identify employees (born in 1965) who are eligibile for participation in a mentorship program. Finally, a report was generated to help prepare management for the "silver tsunami" coming with many of the senior employees reaching their retirement age.
